Perfect! I’ve created a complete, ready-to-use README.md for your FaceDetector project that includes everything: project description, structure, setup, what you learned, notes, and references. You can copy-paste this directly into your repo.

A simple Java project demonstrating *face detection* using the *OpenCV* library. The program detects faces in an input image and marks them with rectangles.

This project allows you to:
- Load an image using OpenCV.
- Detect faces using Haar Cascade Classifier (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml).
- Draw rectangles around detected faces.
- Save the output image with the highlighted faces.
